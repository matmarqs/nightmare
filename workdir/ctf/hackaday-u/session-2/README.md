# Session Two Exercises

These exercises are designed to illusrate the principals that are covered in the course materials, for session two we have the following exercises:

* control-flow-1
* loop-example-1
* variables-example
* func-example-1
* array-example

**Note** You will need to mark these binaries as executable before trying to run them, ex: ```chmod u+x control-flow-1```

Each of these exercises are designed to accept user input from the command line - when the proper input is provided you will get a Success or Congratulatory message.

For example, ```control-flow-1``` takes two values as an input, so you would run it as: ```./control-flow-1 value1 value2```

It is up to you to determine the format and number of these arguments for each exercise by reverse engineering them - if you get stuck please feel free to reach out on the [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/172292-introduction-to-reverse-engineering-with-ghidra) page, or reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wrongbaud/).
